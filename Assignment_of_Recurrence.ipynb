    "### Q1: Finding the value of T(2) for the recurrence relation T(n) = 3T(n-1) + 12n, given that T(0) = 5.\n",

    "To find the value of T(2), we can recursively apply the recurrence relation until we reach T(2). Given that T(0) = 5, we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "T(1) = 3T(0) + 12*1 = 3*5 + 12 = 15 + 12 = 27\n",
    "\n",
    "Then,\n",
    "\n",
    "T(2) = 3T(1) + 12*2 = 3*27 + 12*2 = 81 + 24 = 105\n",

    "\n",
    "a. T(n) = 2T(n-1) + 1\n",
    "\n",
    "In the recursive tree approach, we construct a tree where each level represents a recursive call, and each node represents the cost of that call. Then, we sum up the costs of all nodes to get the total cost.\n",
